		<main>This is my favourite show till now. Some of the reasons why I like this show are:-
			<ul>
				<li>No one is ideal. Like in Indian Daily soap, one individual is shown as the most ideal and also what happens in others life doesn't matter at all. But in this show, everyone is imperfect just like normal people so that we can connect with the show. The show focuses on all characters.</li>
				<li>Everyone have problems in their life. The show focuses on how they overcome their problems slowly through the course of time pretty much humanly rather than super-naturally.</li>
				<li>No one is perfect(The most adorable thing).</li>
				<li>The writer (The way the dialogues and the scenes are created are just great and fantastic)</li>
				<li>Some of the scenes in this show are so iconic that they have a unique place in my heart.</li>
				<li>The connection between some scenes is so unique that makes the audience feels really good.</li>
				<li>All the character have played their parts so effectively that it feels real.</li>
				<li>The couples of this show be it Jack-Rebecca, Randall-Beth, Toby-Kate. Whatever they do together in the show is the most appreciable.(Jack-Rebecca are the best)</li>
				<li>Till now, I have watched only second season. The most comic scene was the "Holy hell of a hot Fiancee`" scene.</li>
				<li>The scenes before Jack's death are the most hearbreaking and the most memorable.</li>
				<li>There is another scene when Rebecca says to Jack "You are cute, when you are dumb". This was also a very comic scene.  </li>
			</ul>
